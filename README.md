Code for TallyQA  dataset published in AAAI 2018


The main paper uses the `RN_BG_OG_embd` model with the reported hyper-parameters in this repo.
There are other types of Relational Models avaialabe in the repo which we tried for our project.

For doing simple vs complex classification we used simpcomp.py.
Run the code as:
```python main.py --model RN_OG_embd ```

Don't forget to edit config.py to point to appropriate  locations for files and features.
Please, feel free to ask if you have any other questions.
